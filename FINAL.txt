Image Processing Script README
Overview

This script performs various image processing tasks on a list of input images. It utilizes the OpenCV library and numpy to achieve color changes and analyze image features. The script contains several functions to achieve different tasks:

    colorchange(i): This function changes specific colors in an image based on their HSV values.

    values(i): This function processes an image to extract certain features, calculates the number of houses on fire, their priorities, and related values.

    final(i): This function combines the color change and values analysis functions for a given image.

    Main Loop: The script loops through a list of input images, applying the final(i) function to each image.

    Sorting: After processing, the script arranges the processed images based on their priority ratios and prints the results.


Output

The script outputs the following information for each input image:

    Number of houses on fire and total houses on grass: second list
    Priority of houses on fire and priority of houses on grass: third list
    Priority ratios: fourth list
    Sorted keys of images based on priority ratios: sortedkeys list
